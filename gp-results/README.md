# Results

In this folder you can find all the results of our experiments.
The results are organized as follows:

* One folder for each experiments
* The name of the folder is composed by the name of the dataset and a Boolean. The Boolean indicates whether the model of phi  was used (True), or solution size (False)
* In each folder there is one file for each different run (seed 1 to 50)
* In each file there are all the solutions at the end of the evolution, duplicated solutions were removed
