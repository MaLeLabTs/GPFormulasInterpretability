# Learning a Formula of Interpretabilityto Learn Interpretable Formulas

In this repository you can find the code and the supplementary material for our article about learning interpretable 
formulas with Genetic Programming.

You can find:

* the [supplementary.pdf](supplementary) material for the article
* the [datasets/](datasets) used for assessing our proposal
* the formulas used for the survey, both for [dec1000-copy](decomposability) and [sim1000-copy](simulatability)
* the [results_335.csv](results) of the survey
* the [Analisi.ipynb](code) used for analyzing the results of the survey, extract the features and compute the linear model
* the [gp-results/](results) of the experiments with pyNSGP

For the code of GP part, you can refer to [https://github.com/marcovirgolin/pyNSGP](this) repository.
